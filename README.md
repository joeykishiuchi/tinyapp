# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

Stretch features have been implemented. The features include using Method-Override to simulate PUT and DELETE methods, as well as an analaytics table on the Short URL page that displays the total visits, total unique visits and a visitor log for that particular shortened URL.
